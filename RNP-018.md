Process

# Overview

The purpose of the Render Network Foundation is "maintaining the core
Render Network protocol and growing its community." In RNP-001, the
Render Network community voted to enact the Burn Mint Equilibrium (BME),
a network economic mechanism. In the proposal, annual allocations are
required. This is the Year 2 of BME Emissions Allocations.

# Reasoning

As we reach the end of our first year running BME --- passed in RNP-001
and revised in RNP-006 --- it makes sense to first review and reflect on
accomplishments of the Render Network and Render Foundation.

Following the ratification of BME, the Render community:

-   Passed 14 RNPs, with 8 passed in 2024

-   Nearly tripled 2023 on-chain network usage (to date)

-   Funded 93 Artist Grants

-   Paid out 1.14M of RENDER upgrade rewards

-   Upgraded 367M RENDER tokens from Ethereum (RNDR) to Solana (RENDER)

-   Brought several Compute Clients to the Render Network

-   Implemented systems to support Network and Foundation Operations

Of the total Year 1 Emissions, (as of Dec 20, 2024) the network will
distribute:

-   1.14M in Community Upgrade Rewards vs 1.14M allocation.

-   1.55M in Render Node Operator Payments and Availability Rewards vs
    1.56M allocation (small timing differences)

-   0.54M in AI / Compute Client rewards (0.75M allocation - difference
    due timing of node onboarding and reward caps per node.)

-   Artist Grants 0.15M vs allocation of 0.54M. Artist grant process
    started in ernest in June 2024, scaling aggressively from Sept 2024,
    so the spend is heavily weighted towards the end of the year. The
    Foundation is now positioned to increase artist grant spend in
    tandem with the new integrations that expand Network reach and
    accessibility.

## Year 2 Budget

Emissions during Year 2 are 5.9M RENDER, as confirmed by RNP-001. After
hours of interviews with every aspect of stakeholders in the
project, discussions during the Initial Proposal Vote, and the outcome
of the Initial Proposal Vote that voted in favour of this split, it is
proposed that the following allocations for Year 2 are enacted:

-   Continue Render Node Rewards at the current weekly levels of 20.7K
    RENDER per week (average of \~90K RENDER per month), and reserving a
    total of 1.5M RENDER (25% of Year 2 emissions) for the growth and
    product release initiatives

-   Increase Artist and AI Client Rewards from 0.54M in 2024 to 1.50M in
    2025, representing 25% of Year 2 Emissions

-   2.9M RENDER (50% of Year 2 budget) to fund operations, for community
    initiatives, R&D and future growth initiatives

## Funded 93 Artist Grants

Received 295 grant applications, focussed on those that have large
followings, highlight Network Strengths and / or push the technical
capabilities of the network. Some examples include:

-   **Alex Pearce** - sim-plates used for background car scenes in
    virtual production and/or on LED walls with specs going up to 24K
    all rendered successfully on the Network

-   **Lebrov Labs** - pushing the boundaries of VFX capabilities,
    creating educational content

-   **David Ariew** - various large format immersive works for display
    at art houses across the world

-   **Samuel Cockings** - short fan-films for Trekyards, the largest
    Star Trek Fan Film channel

-   **jstngraphics** - futuristic short film pushing the technical
    limits of space visualization

-   **Annibale Siconolfi** - futuristic animation pushing the limits of
    what can be created with a small studio

-   **Gryun Kim, Woosung Kang, and Taehoon Park** - WAI VR, an immersive
    short film experience for Apple Vision Pro exhibited in keynote
    presentations at NAB 2024

-   **Blake Kathryn** - an immersive installation experience pushing new
    aesthetic boundaries

-   **V-Studios** - photoreal simulations, visualizations, and
    animations for NASA's Sciencecast public education programs

-   **Antibody TV** - supporting the creation of pilot episodes for
    future streaming productions

## Paid out 1.14M of RENDER Upgrade Rewards

Managed and paid out the Upgrade Rewards for getting users to upgrade
from RNDR to RENDER. 367M RENDER tokens from Ethereum to Solana were
upgraded at the time of writing, representing 63% of the 545M
circulating supply. Voting with RNDR is now deprecated.

## Brought Several Compute Clients to the Render Network

With strong market changes in the last 12 months, the Network adapted to
support the growing demand for GPU compute globally in AI, machine
learning and other non-Rendering related use cases. We continue to build
with compute client partners and develop the capability to serve
well-matched use cases. See more under the RNP updates above and the AI
goals for BME Year 2 below.

## 2024 On-Chain Network Usage

Year over year Network usage has doubled so far and is projected to
approach tripling by the end of 2024. This is represented by continued
organic use of the Network, coupled with OTOY usage in support of the
Roddenberry Archive and particularly proving out the capabilities of
virtual movie production, the use of real-time digital prosthetics and
fast, low cost rendering on the Network. See this [seminal example
here](https://home.otoy.com/unification/). Further, usage
has been bolstered by the Artist Grant program which prioritizes
granting credit to render on the Network. This directly leads to Network
usage and ultimately burning RENDER as part of the BME process.

## Year 2 Budget

Emissions during Year 2 are 5.9M RENDER, as confirmed by RNP-001. After
hours of interviews with every aspect of stakeholders in the the project
it is proposed that the following allocations for Year 2 are enacted:

-   Continue Node Operator Rewards at the current weekly levels of 20.7K
    RENDER per week (average of \~90K RENDER per month), and reserving a
    total of 1.5M RENDER (25% of Year 2 emissions) for the growth and
    product release initiatives

    -   Rewards for nodes balanced with a view to strongly supporting
        the GPU supply side that facilitates the Network growth plans

-   Compute Client lessons since July 2023:

    -   Third party providers have been slow to implement, as such, no
        grants have been paid to compute clients

    -   Compute for non-Render jobs requires development of use-specific
        software and dedicated bandwidth to nurture

    -   Having real-time data on compute client geographic locations and
        specifications will assist responding to real-world demand

    <!-- -->

    -   The Network now has an opportunity for optimizing and refining
        availability rewards for compute client nodes

-   AI Scouts program added:

    -   Researching and identifying new AI projects with strong
        potential in sectors such as finance, healthcare, logistics,
        marketing, and others

    -   Staying informed of the latest trends and developments in the AI
        industry, including emerging technologies, platforms, and
        business applications

    -   Engaging with AI communities, developers, and companies to form
        partnerships and discover promising projects

    -   Evaluating projects based on technical feasibility, business
        value, scalability, and alignment with company objectives

    -   Building relationships with Web 3 creators, founders, and AI
        experts

    -   Facilitating the onboarding process by working with internal
        teams to ensure smooth transitions from project identification
        to integration

-   Increase Artist and AI client rewards from 0.54M in 2024 to 1.50M in
    2025, representing 25% of year 2 emissions

    -   With GPU supply side strong, growing Network use among Digital
        Content Creators ("DCCs") is the largest opportunity for the
        rending side

    -   Grant recipients are pushing the technical frontier of DCC

    -   As the number of integrations with rendering tools expand, ease
        of accessibility to the Network improves

    -   A strong and targeted grant program allows for catalysing demand
        side markets, expanding what can easily be rendered on the
        Network and growing the potential user base

    -   We are seeing increased interest from commercial studios and
        production houses and intend to support grantees in these spaces
        as well

-   2.9M RENDER (50% of Year 2 budget) to fund operations, for community
    initiatives, R&D and future growth initiatives

    -   The fundamental infrastructure has been set up in the Foundation
        to support the maintenance and growth of the Network, and the
        Team has been expanded in both development, community support
        and more recently the AI Scouts team. The Foundation is
        positioned to drive continued growth on the Network, and support
        its strategic initiatives and business partnerships

    -   The Foundation supports an allocation of emissions for community
        rewards and is in [dialogue with the
        Community](https://discord.com/channels/976195870825529354/1301253631567466527)
        to identify the best ideas and the best fit. We encourage
        suggestions that:

        -   Have broad community support

        -   Offer High Value for the long term growth of the Render
            Network

        -   Are Practical to Implement: Proposals that can be feasibly
            integrated into our existing framework without significant
            hurdles

    -   The Foundation is actively seeking projects that offer synergies
        with the Network and proposes to incubate appropriate projects
        with grants, support research in decentralized compute
        protocols, decentralized AI, and blockchain media, and / or
        co-investments foster strong business relationships in the
        sector

## Ongoing and Future Objectives

-   Drive 3x growth in network usage, scaling both the number of users
    and the scale of projects using the Network

-   Create artist enhanced [quick start
    guides](https://know.rendernetwork.com/getting-started/quickstart-for-c4d-blender-unreal-houdini)
    for quick onboarding and micro grant use

-   Comply with jurisdictional reporting requirements

-   Updating the artist portal to accept RENDER (deprioritized over
    projects such as integrating C4D + Redshift, Blender and 3rd party
    storage such as Dropbox into the Render Network workflow)

-   Artist competitions

-   Development of AI Scouts program

-   Development of an accelerator program to partner and help startups
    in the space

-   Support implementation of [the
    Roadmap](https://renderfoundation.com/roadmap) as
    determined by approved RNPs

-   Support Render Network protocol research

-   Support community RNPs that will be funded by the above allocations

# Stakeholders Impacted

This is for all members of the Render community.

# Implementation Plan

Upon the passing of this RNP, Year 2 emissions will be enacted for the
second calendar year of the Burn Mint Equilibrium.

Under the process we already established earlier this year, we expect to
continually review these applications over time and as things change to
ensure emissions are optimized for community needs.

# Technical Considerations

None.

# Potential Drawbacks

As with any forward-looking budget, we might misallocate based on what
we think the needs of the community are. As per RNP-013, we shall
monitor this going forward, and should volumes change materially or new
opportunities emerge, changes will continue at least on a quarterly
basis going forward via the RNP process.

We are super thrilled with the strong community and are looking forward
to Year 2. Budgeting for Year 3 will take place next year around the
same time, with discussions ongoing throughout the year.
