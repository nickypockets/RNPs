# Render Network Governance and Proposal Genesis

The Render Network is a decentralized GPU computing platform that enables creators to harness the power of a distributed compute protocol. As the network grows and evolves, it is crucial to maintain a robust governance framework that allows all stakeholders to collaborate effectively in steering the future direction of the protocol.

The purpose of this Render Network Proposal (RNP) is to formally elevate and codify the governance process for the Render Network. RNPs serve as the primary mechanism through which the Render Network community can propose, debate, and implement changes and improvements to the protocol.

## RNP Structure

To ensure clarity and consistency, each RNP shall adhere to the following standardized template:

1. Title and RNP Number
2. Author(s)
3. Overview
4. Category
5. Reasoning
6. Stakeholders Impacted
7. Implementation Plan
8. Technical Considerations
9. Potential Drawbacks

## Scope of Render Network Proposals

Render Network Proposals should be reserved for significant initiatives that have a substantial impact on the core functionality, governance, or strategic direction of the Render Network. RNPs should propose changes or improvements that are critical to the network's long-term success and require the attention and consensus of the entire community.

Examples of suitable RNPs include, but are not limited to:
- Modifications to the network's rendering algorithms or infrastructure
- Adjustments to the economic model or token mechanics
- Introduction of new features or services that significantly enhance the value proposition of the network
- Changes to the governance process itself

## Render Foundation Grants

For smaller projects, incremental improvements, or initiatives that do not meet the threshold of significance for an RNP, community members are encouraged to explore alternative avenues for support and collaboration.

The Render Foundation, a separate entity dedicated to fostering the growth of the Render ecosystem, offers grants and resources for projects that contribute to the network's development and adoption. Community members with ideas for smaller-scale projects or targeted enhancements should consider applying for a Render Foundation Grant.

Information on the grant application process, eligibility criteria, and funding guidelines can be found on the [Render Foundation website](renderfoundation.com/grants). The Render Foundation Team and community moderators are available to provide guidance and assistance to help direct prospective applicants to the appropriate channel.

By differentiating between significant RNPs and smaller-scale projects suitable for Render Foundation Grants, the community can ensure that the RNP process remains focused on critical governance decisions while still providing support and opportunities for a wide range of initiatives that benefit the Render ecosystem.

## RNP Lifecycle

RNPs shall progress through the following phases from conception to implementation:

### Initial Draft

The proposer shall engage in preliminary discussions with the Render Network community to refine the idea and draft an RNP adhering to the standardized template. An RNP can either be submitted to the Render Network Foundation team for dissemination or a Pull Request can be made to the RNP repository. A dedicated channel within the Render Network Discord server shall be created to facilitate community discussion and feedback on the draft proposal.

RNP proposers should communicate with the Render Foundation to ensure the given proposal falls under the mandate of Render Network protocol improvements. The team will then direct if the given proposal is a candidate for an RNP or a Grant. If a proposal is directly submitted to the repository and falls under Grant mandates, the Render Foundation may reject an RNP proposal. Grant information can be found on the Render Foundation Website.

### Initial Proposal Vote

The draft RNP shall be put forth for a simple majority vote to gauge community interest and support. This vote shall remain open for a period of 72 hours and shall not be subject to any quorum requirement. Should the proposal garner majority support, it shall proceed to the Final RNP Vote phase.

### Final RNP Vote

The refined RNP shall be presented to the community for a decisive vote conducted through the voting platform (as of writing, [Snapshot](snapshot.org) and [NATION](nation.io)). The voting period shall span 6 days. For an RNP to be considered approved, it must satisfy the following criteria:
- Attain a majority approval of at least 50% of the total votes cast
- Achieve a quorum of at least 15% of the total combined RNDR and RENDER token supply participating in the vote
- Snapshots of RENDER SPL and RNDR ERC tokens will typically be captured within 24-hours of a vote going live.

### Implementation

Upon approval, RNPs shall be incorporated into the Render Network's development roadmap and implemented by core Render Network contributors. The status and progress of each RNP shall be transparently tracked and communicated via the Render Foundation Team and in the designated GitHub repository.


All RNP statuses can be viewed within Github, where they will be classified
as "In Render Team Review", "Open for RNP Vote", "Rejected", "Approved and on
the Roadmap", “In Development” and “Implemented”.

## Emergency Proposal Provision

In the event of an emergency situation necessitating swift action to ensure the uninterrupted operation of the Render Network, the Initial Proposal Vote phase may be omitted, and the quorum requirement for the Final RNP Vote shall be elevated to 20% of the total Render token supply.

## Amendments
RNPs can undergo updates to enhance clarity or incorporate new information for improved accuracy. These revisions aim to maintain the original intent of the proposal. Amendments may include adjustments such as correcting typographical errors, updating technical details, or reflecting changes like a Compute Client's name alteration. Large amendments will be submitted to vote for a shortened period of two days if deemed necessary by the Render Foundation team.

## RNP Content Guidelines

To maintain the integrity and effectiveness of the RNP process, members should research previously submitted proposals to avoid duplication or conflicts. RNPs that overlap with an active proposal will be deferred until a significant time has elapsed after the original proposal's vote concludes. The Render Foundation reserves the right to remove RNPs from consideration if they involve illegal activity, hate speech, pornographic material, discriminatory content, copyrighted material without permission, or other content that violates the mission, values, or Code of Conduct of the Render Network.

## Conclusion

By establishing this transparent, inclusive, and collaborative RNP process, the Render Network will exemplify decentralized governance and harness the collective wisdom of its diverse community to drive ongoing innovation and improvement of the protocol. As the community gains experience with decentralized decision-making, the RNP process itself may evolve to better serve the needs of the network and its stakeholders as well.
